## Project Overview

- In this project, the code facilitates a credit card form, enabling real-time updates of the cardholder name, expiration date, and CVV.

- It also includes features for formatting and validating both the card number and CVV inputs.

- The front and back faces of the card were rotated using the transform property in the project. This feature is utilized as a powerful tool in CSS to alter the size, shape, position, and rotation of elements. You may refer to the following sources for further information.
